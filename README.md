# Cookies-Sales-Data-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating dashboard and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, Including data preprocessing, data cleaning , and data visualization.

- Analyzed cookies sales data using Power BI for insights on performance and customer behavior.
- Implemented DAX functions for calculated columns: "Days of Week" and "Has/Has Not Chocolates".
- Established relationships between tables (Cookie Type, Customers, Orders) for accurate data integration.
- Developed key measures including (Profit Margin as a percentage, Total Number of Cookies Sold, Total Orders Received, Total Profit).
- Visualized data in a matrix format for clear comparison of sales metrics across different dimensions.
